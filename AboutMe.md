Hello there, I’m Gabe.
I’m interested in geographic information systems, geospatial science, astrodynamics, and application development.
I’m a geospatial imagery analyst and an aspiring programmer, currently learning Python as my first language. I hope to learn JavaScript next.
I hope to work in a position that leverages both my current knowledge of geography with my growing knowledge of coding, as a GIS app developer.

I can be reached primarily at my personal email or messaged on Facebook, both listed below:
